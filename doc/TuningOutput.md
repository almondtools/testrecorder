Tuning Testrecorder Output
==========================

It is planned that you could tune the generated tests by giving hints how a serialized object should be represented in the test.

Some of these features are experimentally implemented, some are only planned: 

## Hints

Hints are provided as annotations to classes, parameters or fields. The following hint annotations will be supported: 

### SkipChecks
TODO (file an issue if you feel documentation or implementation of this feature would help you)

### LoadFromFile
TODO (file an issue if you feel documentation or implementation of this feature would help you)
